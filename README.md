A bus reservation system is a software application that allows users to book bus tickets, view bus schedules, and manage seat availability. The system is built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface and MySQL for database management. Here's a high-level description of a bus reservation system using Java Swing and MySQL:

User Interface:
The system has a user-friendly GUI built using Java Swing components such as buttons, text fields, labels, tables, etc.
The GUI provides options for users to search for buses, view available seats, select seats, enter passenger details, and make reservations.

Database Design:
The system uses MySQL to store and manage data related to buses, schedules, seat availability, reservations, and passenger information.
The database schema includes tables such as Bus, Schedule, Seat, Reservation, and Passenger with appropriate relationships and foreign keys.

Bus and Schedule Management:
The system allows administrators to add, edit, and delete bus details such as bus number, route, type, capacity, etc.
Administrators can also manage bus schedules by specifying departure and arrival times, dates, and associated bus details.

Seat Availability:
The system retrieves seat availability information from the database based on the selected bus and schedule.
Users can view the seat layout, highlighting available seats, booked seats, and already reserved seats.

Reservation Process:
Users can select available seats and enter passenger details like name, contact information, etc.
The system validates the entered data, checks seat availability, and creates a reservation entry in the database.
The seat availability status is updated in the database to reflect the newly booked seats.

Booking History:
The system allows users to view their booking history, displaying details of their previous reservations.
Users can also cancel their reservations, which updates the seat availability status and removes the reservation entry from the database.

Overall, this bus reservation system using Java Swing and MySQL provides a user-friendly interface for bus ticket booking, manages seat availability, handles reservation processes, and maintains a database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
